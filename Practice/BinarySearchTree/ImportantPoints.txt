A Binary Search Tree is a special form of a binary tree. The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to)
any values in its left subtree but less than (or equal to) any values in its right subtree.

Like a normal binary tree, we can traverse a BST in preorder, inorder, postorder or level-order. However, it is
noteworthy that inorder traversal in BST will be in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal is the most 
frequent used traversal method of a BST.

We also have exercises for you to find the inorder successor in a BST after this article. Obviously, you can do the 
inorder traversal to find the inorder successor in a BST. But please try to apply the property of the BST we have 
learned to find out a better way to solve this problem.
