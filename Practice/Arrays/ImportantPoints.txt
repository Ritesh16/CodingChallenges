1. Arrays can be sorted to solve a problem. But remember, sorting arrays itself require complexity of O(logn). So it cannot be sorted for all solutions.
2. 2-pointer technique. In this technique, we can read arrays using 2 pointers. It is really good technique, where we can maintain one regular pointer and then 
second pointer either in reverse or in any where in middle of array.
3. 1-pass and 2-pass technique in array
4. Even in some cases we can have 3-pointers. Like solving problem of MErge sorted arrays.
