Introducing Window Functions With OVER - Exercises
Exercise 1


Create a query with the following columns:

FirstName and LastName, from the Person.Person table**

JobTitle, from the HumanResources.Employee table**

Rate, from the HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory table**

A derived column called "AverageRate" that returns the average of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row



**All the above tables can be joined on BusinessEntityID



All the tables can be inner joined, and you do not need to apply any criteria.





Exercise 2


Enhance your query from Exercise 1 by adding a derived column called

"MaximumRate" that returns the largest of all values in the "Rate" column, in each row





Exercise 3


Enhance your query from Exercise 2 by adding a derived column called

"DiffFromAvgRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:



An employees's pay rate, MINUS the average of all values in the "Rate" column.





Exercise 4


Enhance your query from Exercise 3 by adding a derived column called

"PercentofMaxRate" that returns the result of the following calculation:



An employees's pay rate, DIVIDED BY the maximum of all values in the "Rate" column, times 100.
